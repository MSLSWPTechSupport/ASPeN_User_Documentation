## Continuing Education Programs

The Montana State Library offers a continuing education program for library directors, staff, and trustees.  Participants in the program must earn a certain number of credits in different subject areas to become certified in our continuing education program.  The programs vary depending upon the work duties and interests of the person participating in the program.
