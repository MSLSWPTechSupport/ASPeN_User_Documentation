# ASPeN Manual

## Persons

ASPeN has a lot of granularity in what it can do.  It separates out the actual human being (the Person) from the position that person holds.  This gives us the ability to assign certain rights to an individual.  It allows us to create a system where any continuing education hours earned by a person will follow that person no matter what position they might hold in the library community.
