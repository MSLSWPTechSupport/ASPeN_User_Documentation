## Federations

Montana is divided up into six regions. Libraries within those regions have formed a federation. It's a formal and informal way to network and improve library services in Montana. The six federations are:

* BROAD VALLEYS
* GOLDEN PLAINS
* PATHFINDER
* SAGEBRUSH
* SOUTH CENTRAL
* TAMARACK
