# ASPeN Manual

## Services

ASPeN has a category called services.  This term is used to describe anything that a group of libraries might belong to that provides a service or requires the same report from several libraries.  Examples of services within the Montana library community are the Montana Shared Catalog, Montana Memory Project, or Montana Library 2 Go.  Each of these services requires libraries to apply or enroll in the service.  Once in the service they receive similar benefits and are frequently asking for the same kinds of information.  By creating a service, ASPeN allows system administrators to upload that information in one place and target any requests for information directly to the participants of a service.
