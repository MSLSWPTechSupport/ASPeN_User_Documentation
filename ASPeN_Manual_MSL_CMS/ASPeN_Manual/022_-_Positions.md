# ASPeN Manual

## Positions

Positions are the jobs within the Montana library community that an individual holds.  Most people listed in ASPeN have only one position within the Montana library community.  However, there are people who have jobs in two different libraries or they serve on a State Library committee and hold a position at a Montana library.  ASPeN can display all of the positions of an individual person.
