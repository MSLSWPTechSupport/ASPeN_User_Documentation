## Responsibilities

Responsibilities is the term used to describe the editing and system administration rights a position has within ASPeN.  Responsibilities are tied to positions not people.  Why?  One person might be a director at one library with all of the rights of editing that library's information, but they might be serving on a committee of the Montana State Library as another position.  As a committee member, that person does not have the right to edit committee information.  By tying responsibilities to positions, ASPeN can distinguish between these two roles and what an individual can do with the program.
