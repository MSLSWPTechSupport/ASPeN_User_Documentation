ASPeN Admin Manual
City Types
FirstPrevNextLast
Cities are recognized towns and population centers in Montana.  New cities should not be added to ASPeN unless it is a confirmed change or new town.  A city type indicated whether or not it is a census designated place, incorporated town, or other place.  Types should also not be added or changed within ASPeN unless it clearly needs to be corrected or added based on a change in census data or a change in the status of the town.
