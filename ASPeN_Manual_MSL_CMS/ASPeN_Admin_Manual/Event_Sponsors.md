Event Sponsors
FirstPrevNextLast
When adding an event to ASPeN, you can indicate who is sponsoring the event.  In many cases, this will be the Montana State Library.  We sometimes host or advertise events that are sponsored by other organizations such as Montana Library Association, and this feature lets you explain that.
