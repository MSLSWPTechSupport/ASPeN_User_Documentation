FirstPrevNextLast
Event images can be searched by the event name or by category.  Current categories include conferences, workshops, and meetings.  State Library staff can add categories to the list.  These categories are searchable which allows staff to find all of the pictures for a particular category.  Found images can be displayed in a slideshow.
