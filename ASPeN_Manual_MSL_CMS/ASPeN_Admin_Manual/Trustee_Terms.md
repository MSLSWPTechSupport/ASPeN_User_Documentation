Trustee Terms
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN will display information about the term of a board member - for any type of library.  Trustee terms can be found on public library and State Library pages.  For example, those with editing privileges can indicate whether or not this is a first term or whether or not this person was a Higher Ed 3-Year Term.  System Admins can create new trustee terms.
