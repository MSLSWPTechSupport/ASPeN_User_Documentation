ASPeN Admin Manual
System Help Request Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has a help desk feature within it.  If a librarian is having a problem or has a question about ASPeN, they can click on ASPeN Help and "Contact Us" to submit their question.  The system automatically populates the form with their information and sends an email to designated staff members.  MSL ASPeN Admins and IT staff can login to the system to handle these requests.

ASPeN categorizes the requests using System Help Request Types.  Currently, there are only two options - request for information and error.  System Admins can add additional request types as needed.
