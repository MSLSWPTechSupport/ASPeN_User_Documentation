ASPeN Admin Manual
Service Super Types
FirstPrevNextLast
Service Super Types is the largest umbrella used to describe a service.  It allows ASPeN to display all of the services attached to a particular category. For example, there is a service super type of statewide projects that when used to describe a service will allow the user to see all services categorized as "statewide projects."  This also somewhat determines what kind of data is collected from librarians and what is displayed.  The system administrator has power over what librarians and board members see, but generally we expect that something categorized as "data collections" is going to require collecting data from librarians.
