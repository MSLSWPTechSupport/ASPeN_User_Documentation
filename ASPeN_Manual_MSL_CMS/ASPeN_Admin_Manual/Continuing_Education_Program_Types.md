Continuing Education Program Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN is primarily for the continuing education programs managed by the Montana State Library.  We hope that local organizations will eventually be able to create their own continuing education programs for staff who want to earn continuining education credit, but don't need to take as many continuing education hours as the State Library requires for its program.  ASPeN will then keep track of the employee's progress on the local continuing education program.

Continuing Education Program Type refers to whether or not the continuing education program is one sponsored by the State Library or by a local organization.
