ASPeN Admin Manual
Event Task Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has a reminder feature that allows you to add tasks that need to be completed for an event.  If you add a task such as "arrange lunch or snacks" to the event, ASPeN will send you email reminders until you mark that task completed.

The status of an event task can be changed in ASPeN as you move from pending to completed.
