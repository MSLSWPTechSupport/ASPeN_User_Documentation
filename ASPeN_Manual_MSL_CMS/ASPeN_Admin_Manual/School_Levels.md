ASPeN Admin Manual
School Levels
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN will display the school level that a library serves.  MSL ASPeN Admins can create new school levels, but this should only be done if it is truly needed.  These school levels have been the levels historically used since MSL has had a directory.  They represent the most common levels of elementary school, highschool, K-12, and school-community libraries.
