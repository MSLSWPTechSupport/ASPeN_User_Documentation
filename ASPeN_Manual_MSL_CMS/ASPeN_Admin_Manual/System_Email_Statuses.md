ASPeN Admin Manual
System Email Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN generates automatic emails that are sent to a user based on work that user is doing with ASPeN.  For example if a user requests help with ASPeN, the system will generate an email with their request that is sent to MSL staff members in charge of handling tech support for ASPeN.

State Library staff members can create system emails that come from the staff member's email account.  When would you want to do this?  If you are administering a service like the Montana Shared Catalog, you could create a bulk email that would go to all of the members.  This doesn't work like a listserv, so it's wise to use this feature sparingly.  If you needed to immmediately send a message to all member libraries - like if the system went down - you could use ASPeN.

ASPeN will show you the status of an email.  Current options are sent, not sent, and inactive.  State Library staff can create new email statuses as needed.
