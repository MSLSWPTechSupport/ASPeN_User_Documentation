ASPeN Admin Manual
Continuing Education Super Categories
FirstPrevNextLast
Currently, the Montana State Library's Continuing Education program only has four categories.  These are called super categories in ASPeN.  State Library staff can create new super categories or change the existing ones by using the system administrator features within ASPeN.  This should only be completed if the State Library Commission has approved the changes to the continuing education categories.
