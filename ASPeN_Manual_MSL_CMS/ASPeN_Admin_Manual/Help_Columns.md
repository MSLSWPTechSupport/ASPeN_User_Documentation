ASPeN Admin Manual
Help Columns
FirstPrevNextLast
Help columns are where the information behind the "i" buttons resides.  The "i" buttons display quick, general information about a feature within ASPeN.  Help Databases - used to tell the system where the "i" buttons need to appear -,  Help Columns, and Help Tables - which connect specific "i" columns with the correct ASPeN help manual - work together to run the help system within ASPeN.
