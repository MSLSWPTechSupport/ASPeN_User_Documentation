Form Field Options
FirstPrevNextLast
Form fields are used to create the questions that you need to ask the person completing the form.  They are dynamic and will change depending upon the options you choose.  If you choose an option of text for an answer to a question, you will not need to create answers like you would if you chose multiple choice for your question type.
