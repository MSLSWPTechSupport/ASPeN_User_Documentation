System Help Request Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has a help desk feature within it.  If a librarian is having a problem or has a question about ASPeN, they can click on ASPeN Help and "Contact Us" to submit their question.  The system automatically populates the form with their information and sends an email to designated staff members.  MSL ASPeN Admins and IT staff can login to the system to handle these requests.

The system has a status feature that admins can use to mark a request as pending or completed.  System Admins can create a new help request system status if needed.
