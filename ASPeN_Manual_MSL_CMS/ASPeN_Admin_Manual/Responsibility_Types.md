ASPeN Admin Manual
Responsibility Types
FirstPrevNextLast
Responsiblity types are sometimes created by ASPeN itself. This happens when an individual creates an event or form within ASPeN.  The system will automatically log them as an administrator for the event or form thereby giving that individual the authority needed to edit or change the event or form.  MSL ASPeN Admins can also create responsibility types.  This is a very advanced feature and should be done while working closely with MSL IT staff.
