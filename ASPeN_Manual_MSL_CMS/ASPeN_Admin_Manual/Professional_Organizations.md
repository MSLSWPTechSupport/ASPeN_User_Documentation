ASPeN Admin Manual
Professional Organizations
FirstPrevNextLast
Professional organizations include things like the Montana Library Association or the American Library Association.  These are organizations that librarians or board members might belong to, and that they might wish to see reflected in ASPeN.  MSL staff can add new professional organizations using the features within ASPeN Admin.  Best practice would be to add only organizations that multiple Montana librarians or board members belong to in order to keep the database fairly clean.
