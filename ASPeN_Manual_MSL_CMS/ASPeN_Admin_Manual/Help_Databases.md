FirstPrevNextLast
Help Databases is how the system associates the text of an "i" button with the proper table where the information needs to appear.  The "i" buttons display quick, general information about a feature within ASPeN.  Help Databases, Help Columns  - where the actual "i" text can be edited and created - , and Help Tables - which connect specific "i" columns with the correct ASPeN help manual - work together to run the help system within ASPeN.
