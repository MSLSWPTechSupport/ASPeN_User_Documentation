ASPeN Admin Manual
Continuing Education Category Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPen provides a learning management function. Trainers can request that State Library staff review the trainer's course to determine what continuing education category the course should receive.  Trainers can do this within the ASPeN system.  This request goes to the Continuing Education Coordinator or their designee.  The course's continuing education status will be pending until the Continuing Education Coordinator either approves or denies the category.
