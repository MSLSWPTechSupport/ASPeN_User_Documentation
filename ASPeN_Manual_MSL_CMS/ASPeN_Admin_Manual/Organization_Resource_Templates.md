ASPeN Admin Manual
Organization Resource Templates
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN gives system administrators the power to create templates.  This may be useful when there is a type of document that State Library staff frequently request of librarians or other members of the library community.  A template creates parameters that an end user must follow when uploading a particular document.  This creates standardization across the system.
