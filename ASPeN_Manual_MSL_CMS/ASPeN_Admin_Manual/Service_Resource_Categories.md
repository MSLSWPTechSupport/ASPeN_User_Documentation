ASPeN Admin Manual
Service Resource Categories
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN allows users to upload resources related to a service.  This is particularly helpful for things like meeting materials or applications to enroll. An MSL staff member can add these resources and use event resource categories to explain what the resource is such as it's financial or a map or a policy document. If you add a resource category to the resource that was uploaded, users will be able to search the system for all items that fall within that category.
