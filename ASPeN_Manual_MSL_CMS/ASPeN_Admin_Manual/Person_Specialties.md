ASPeN Admin Manual
Person Specialties
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN allows a user to share information about specialties (either training, skills, or knowledge) that the user has and is willing to share with others.  This information is not required.  It is a way for people to share their professional abilities with others if they wish to do so.  If someone would like to add a person specialty that doesn't appear in the drop down menu, MSL staff can create a new specialty using ASPeN Admin either by going to the user's record or choosing "Manage All Folders" and "Person Specialties."
