Service Enrollment Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has the capability of creating forms for librarian to use to enroll in a service such as OCLC Group Services.  Enrollment Types describe the methods that can be used to enroll a library in a service from no enrollment needed - the library is automatically a member like federation libraries - to manual - call MSL staff - to a more formal system generated form that may require additional information from a library before they are accepted in the service.
