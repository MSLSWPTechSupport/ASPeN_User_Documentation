Service Participation Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
Service participation statuses are used to show the status of a library's participation in a service.  These statuses are mostly used in situations where the library has to complete an enrollment application to be a part of the service.  For example, a library might wish to apply to be an MSC member library.  They would need to complete an application form.  As soon as they start the process, they would show up in the list as not submitted.  Once they submittedthe application form, it would change the status accordingly.  MSL staff could then mark the application as approved or denied once it was reviewed. If a member library closes or no longer wishes to participate in a service, MSL staff can mark their participation as terminated.

MSL staff can add new statuses, but it is best to work together to make sure that we aren't adding additional statuses that will rarely be used.
