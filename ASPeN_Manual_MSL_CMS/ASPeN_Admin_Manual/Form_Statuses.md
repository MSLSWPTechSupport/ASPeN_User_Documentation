ASPeN Admin Manual
Form Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
Form Statuses indicate whether or not a form is open for collection or in process.  ASPeN gives you the power to close and open a form.  You can also indicate where you are in the process of creating a form.  The form will not display to the end user until you open it for collection.  The additional statuses of closed or ready for collection communicate a form's status to your colleagues.
