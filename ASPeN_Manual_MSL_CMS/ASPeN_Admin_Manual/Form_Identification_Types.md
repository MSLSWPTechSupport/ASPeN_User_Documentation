ASPeN Admin Manual
Form Identification Types
FirstPrevNextLast
Form Identification Types determine where a form will display within ASPeN and who will see that form.  It also determines what types of fields you will see as you create a form.  Forms can be designed to be completed by an individual.  They can also be designed to be completed for an organization.  For example the State Library only wants one public library statistics form from each public library, but we might want individual responses from attendees at a class.  Forms can also be associated with a particular event or service.
