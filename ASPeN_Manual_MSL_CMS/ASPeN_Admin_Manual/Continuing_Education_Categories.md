Continuing Education Categories
FirstPrevNextLast
Participants in the Montana State Library Continuing Education Program must take a certain number of hours in different subject areas.  We use the term continuing education categories to describe these subject areas.  Library Directors cannot change these categories.  Only State Library personnel can add or delete categories.  Participants in the continuing education program can monitor their progress within ASPeN by using the Continuing Education module.
