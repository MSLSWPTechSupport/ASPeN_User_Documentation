Organization Specialties
FirstPrevNextLast
Libraries may have certain subject areas or services that are unique to their library and community.  If they wish to do so, library directors can add an organization specialty for their library.  If a specialty is not present, the library director can request that State Library staff add a new organization specialty.  Staff need to make sure they aren't duplicating a specialty.  Whenever possible, please use common terms.
