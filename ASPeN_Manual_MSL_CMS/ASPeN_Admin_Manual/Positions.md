ASPeN Admin Manual
Positions
FirstPrevNextLast
Positions are the jobs within the Montana library community that an individual holds.  Most people listed in ASPeN have only one position within the Montana library community.  However, there are people who have jobs in two different libraries or they serve on a State Library committee and hold a position at a Montana library.  ASPeN can display all of the positions of an individual person.

Master editors or assigned editors can add, replace, or remove positions for their library.  MSL Staff can edit any positions and can add new positions to a library.  Positions that are "deleted" remain in the system as inactive.  This maintains that information for historical purposes, and makes it easy for a director or MSL staff member to re-create that position if it is ever filled.
