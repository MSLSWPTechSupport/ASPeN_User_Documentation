Form Field Types
FirstPrevNextLast
Form Field Types describe what kind of answer you need for a question on a form.  They are used to design your questions.  An example of a form field type is DropDownList.  If you choose this option, you are asking the person completing the form to select one option from a drop down list.  You will need to create that list within ASPeN in order for the form to work correctly.
