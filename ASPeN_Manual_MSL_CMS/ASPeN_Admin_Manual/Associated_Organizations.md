Associated Organizations
FirstPrevNextLast
Associated organizations are branches or other libraries that have a formal relationship with another library.  For example a main library may be located in the county seat, but it may have branches in nearby towns in the same county.  In ASPeN those branches are referred to as associated organizations.

Libraries can add or remove an associated organization by finding their organization and selecting edit organization additional information.
