Event Resource Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN allows users to upload resources related to an event.  This is particularly helpful for things like meetings or workshops.  A user can upload an agenda or a presentation for a specific event.  Standard formats such as word documents, adobe pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and images can be uploaded.

The Event Resource Type describes the resource.  This gives users an easy way to see that it is an agenda or meeting minutes.
