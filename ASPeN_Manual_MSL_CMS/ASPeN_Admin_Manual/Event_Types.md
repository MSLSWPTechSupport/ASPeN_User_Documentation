ASPeN Admin Manual
Event Types
FirstPrevNextLast
When you add an event in ASPeN, you need to specify what type of event it is.  ASPeN is dynamic and will change menu options depending upon what type of event you add.  In addition, it is nice for users and the public to be able to tell at a glance what type of event is on the calendar.  Event  types are common things like meetings, deadlines, and continuing education.
