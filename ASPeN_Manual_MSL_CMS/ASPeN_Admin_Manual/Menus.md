FirstPrevNextLast
System Administrators (IT Staff and the Director of Library Development) can create new menus.  Menus are used to control what people with different responsibilities will see when they login to ASPeN and click on ASPeN Admin.  If you need to make a change to what is displayed, please contact one of the system administrators for assistance.
