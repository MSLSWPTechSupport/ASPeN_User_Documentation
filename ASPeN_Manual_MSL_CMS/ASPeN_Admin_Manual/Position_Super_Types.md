ASPeN Admin Manual
Position Super Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has position types and super types.  It's best to describe these together.  A super type is the highest level within ASPeN.  It is a term used to describe a broad range of positions.  For example, there is a position super type of "board chair."  This can describe any board chair.  ASPeN then uses position type to add more granularity.  A board chair position type could be the chair of a library board, the chair of a State Library committee, or even the chair of a State Library council.

Only MSL ASPeN Admins can create new super types.  These should be used sparingly.  They are connected to the position type which is one of the things used by ASPeN to determine responsibilities and roles.
