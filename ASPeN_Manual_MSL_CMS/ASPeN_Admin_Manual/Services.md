ASPeN Admin Manual
Services
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has a category called services.  This term is used to describe anything that a group of libraries might belong to that provides a service or requires the same report from several libraries.  Examples of services within the Montana library community are the Montana Shared Catalog, Montana Memory Project, or Montana Library 2 Go.  Each of these services requires libraries to apply or enroll in the service.  Once in the service they receive similar benefits and are frequently asking for the same kinds of information.  By creating a service, ASPeN allows system administrators to upload that information in one place and target any requests for information directly to the participants of a service.



State Library staff can create a new service when needed.  The system is designed to be flexible.  If you need a service to have everything - ability to upload documents, enroll members in an application process, and share information with members - it can do that.  It can also simply be a place where libraries belonging to a service are listed.
