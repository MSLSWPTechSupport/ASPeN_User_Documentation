Service Image Categories
FirstPrevNextLast
Images related to a service can be searched by the name or by category.  Current categories include Library Development, Federations, and library types such as academic, school, and public.  State Library staff can add categories to the list.  These categories are searchable which allows staff to find all of the pictures for a particular category.  Found images can be displayed in a slideshow.
