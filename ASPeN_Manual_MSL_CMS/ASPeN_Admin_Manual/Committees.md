Committees
FirstPrevNextLast
Libraries may not use committees very often, but the Montana State Library has several committees that advise and govern our work.  We have included information about those committees within ASPeN.  You will be able to see information about the role a committee plays, who is a part of the committee and when it meets.  You will also be able to access committee documents.
