Continuing Education Learning Resource Continuing Education Credits
FirstPrevNextLast
There are a variety of ways to earn continuing education credit.  You can take a workshop, attend a conference, or view a webinar.  If you take any of these through the Montana State Library, ASPeN will automatically keep track of State Library events.  If you view a recorded webinar or take a tutorial that was created by another organization like the American Library Association, it is referred to as a Continuing Education Learning Resource.

This helps the system determine the difference between a live, MSL or partner sponsored, event, an out of state conference, or an asynchronous learning event that took place with another organization.
