FirstPrevNextLast
Form Categories allow the user to search for every form that falls in a particular category.  Categories are broad descriptions of the type of form.  State Library staff can define what type of form they have created by using categories.  Current categories include data collection which would be used for things like statistics or standards.  Other categories include applications, event registrations, and surveys.
