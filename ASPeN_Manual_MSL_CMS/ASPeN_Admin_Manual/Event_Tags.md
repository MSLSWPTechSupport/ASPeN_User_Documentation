Event Tags
FirstPrevNextLast
Tags can be added to increase the level of granularity when searching for events.  State Library staff can add additional tags to the system.  Current tags reflect the event itself or who might be sponsoring the event.  For example you might add a tag of Montana Library Association.  Doing this makes it possible for staff and the public to search for events that involve the Montana Library Association.
