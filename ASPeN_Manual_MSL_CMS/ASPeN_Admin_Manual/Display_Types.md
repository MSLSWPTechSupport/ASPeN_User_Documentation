ASPeN allows system administrators to control who sees certain pieces of information.  Our default is public which means the information is displayed to everyone which doesn't require logging into ASPeN.

Certain pieces of information like survey responses or legal documents may need to be visible only to those with authorized access.  ASPeN has the ability to set this level of access from only administrators can see the information, to library administrators being able to see information, to library staff members, or the wider library community being able to see the information.  In all of the above cases, the user would need to login to ASPeN to see the information.
