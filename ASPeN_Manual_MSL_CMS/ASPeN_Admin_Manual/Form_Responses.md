ASPeN Admin Manual
Form Responses
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has the power to collect information from members of the library community.  It does this through forms that can be shared with the entire library community or certain populations within the community.  An example of limiting who responds to forms would be having a form for public library directors to complete their public library statistics.

Form responses show the data that was collected with our requests for information.  ASPeN can display these responses in charts in order to reveal themes.  System Administrators can download responses to forms in order to complete a more indepth analysis of the information.
