ASPeN Admin Manual
Event Image Tags
FirstPrevNextLast
Tags can be added to increase the level of granularity when searching for event images.  State Library staff can add additional tags to the system.  Current tags reflect the event itself.  For example when adding the Montana Shared Catalog spring meeting to ASPeN, an image of a past meeting might be uploaded to the event.  The staff member can then tag the event as being a part of the Montana Shared Catalog.  Doing this makes it possible for staff and the public to search for images of the Montana Shared Catalog.
