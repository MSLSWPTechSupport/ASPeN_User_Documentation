ILL Transfer Options
FirstPrevNextLast
This is a legacy field from the Montana Library Directory.  At one time, it was important for the State Library to keep track of how libraries handled interlibrary loan.  We chose to keep this field for historical purposes.  Libraries can choose a variety of methods for offering Interlibary Loan (ILL) from not offering the service to offering it via email, using OCLC, or even using an automated, unmediated process.
