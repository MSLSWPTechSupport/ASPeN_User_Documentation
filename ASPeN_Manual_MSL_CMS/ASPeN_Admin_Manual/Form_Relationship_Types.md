Form Relationship Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has the ability to create relationships between forms.  This is useful for collating and analyzing data.  The most common relationship is parent-child.  In this situation, one file has the required data about a subject such as a library.  The child form might have additional information about that library.  Establishing that relationship allows you to see the connections between the different forms requested of a library.
