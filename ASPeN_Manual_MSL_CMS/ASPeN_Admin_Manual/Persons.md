ASPeN Admin Manual
Persons
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has a lot of granularity in what it can do.  It separates out the actual human being (the Person) from the position that person holds.  This gives us the ability to assign certain rights to an individual.  It allows us to create a system where any continuing education hours earned by a person will follow that person no matter what position they might hold in the library community.

Users with editing and/or administrative privileges will be able to create new person records within ASPeN.  Library Directors can follow the path to adding a new person by updating their staff information.  MSL staff will need to use the "Manage" Persons option under ASPeN Admin.
