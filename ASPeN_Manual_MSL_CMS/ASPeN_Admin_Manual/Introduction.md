Welcome to ASPeN - Access to Services, Programs, and eNetworks.

This product provides a variety of services for Montana's library community.  Members of the public can search ASPeN to find a nearby library or learn more about their local library.  Library Directors will be able to update their library's information, enroll in certain services, keep track of their continuing education, and complete paperwork required by the Montana State Library.

This manual is for administrators and will briefly define some of the terms and features within ASPeN.
