Continuing Education
FirstPrevNextLast
The Montana State Library believes that continuing education is a critical part of librarianship.  The world is constantly changing, so it is wise for all of us to take classes that keep us up to date and informed about those changes.  We have a certification program for library directors, staff, and trustees.  Volunteers and non-librarians are welcome to participate in the program as well.

Participants in our program receive credit for each hour of continuing education they receive.  This continuing education credit can be earned by attending webinars and face to face workshops, or taking formal courses.  You will be able to use ASPeN's continuing education module to keep track of their hours.  You can also use this module to apply for certification.
