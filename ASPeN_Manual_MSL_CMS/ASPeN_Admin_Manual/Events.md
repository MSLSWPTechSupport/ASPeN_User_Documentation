ASPeN Admin Manual
Events
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has a calendar of events.  This calendar includes meetings, workshops, and webinars.  System administrators can add an event to the calendar and set up online registration for events with limited seating or events where the organizer needs to know how many are attending.  The public can see these events.  Members of the library community can register for events within ASPeN.

State Library staff members can add events to ASPeN using the administrator functions within ASPeN.
