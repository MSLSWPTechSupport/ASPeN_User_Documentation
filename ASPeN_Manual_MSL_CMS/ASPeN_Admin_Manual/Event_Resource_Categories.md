ASPeN Admin Manual
Event Resource Categories
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN allows users to upload resources related to an event.  This is particularly helpful for things like meetings or workshops.  A user can upload an agenda or a presentation for a specific event.  Event Resource Categories allow the user to explain what the resource is related to - is it part of a workshop?  Or is it the financials for a State Library Commission meeting?  If you add a resource category to the resource that was uploaded, users will be able to search the system for all items that fall within that category.
