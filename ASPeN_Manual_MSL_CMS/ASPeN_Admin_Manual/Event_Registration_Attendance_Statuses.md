ASPeN Admin Manual
Event Registration Attendance Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN allows staff to keep track of attendance at events.  When a person registers for an event, it will mark their attendance as pending.  Once the person has attended the event, a State Library staff member can mark them as having attended the event.  If the person is unable to attend, State Library staff can mark the event as missed.

This feature was added as part of the certification program.  It allows State Library staff to verify attendance at events.
