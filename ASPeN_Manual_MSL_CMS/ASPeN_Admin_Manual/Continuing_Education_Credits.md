Participants in the Montana State Library's certification program receive credit for each hour of continuing education they receive.  This continuing education credit can be earned by attending webinars and face to face workshops, or taking formal courses.  You will be able to use ASPeN's continuing education module to keep track of their hours.  You can also use this module to apply for certification.
