Organization Types
FirstPrevNextLast
Organization Types refers to what type of organization is displayed or searched.  ASPeN was designed to include the Digital Library community (including the GIS community) when it was created.  State Library staff can create a new organization type if those communities are ever included within ASPeN.  Currently the organization type defines what type of library is being displayed or searched.
