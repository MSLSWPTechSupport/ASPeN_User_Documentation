ASPeN Admin Manual
Position Types
FirstPrevNextLast
ASPeN has position types and super types.  It's best to describe these together.  A super type is the highest level within ASPeN.  It is a term used to describe a broad range of positions.  For example, there is a position super type of "board chair."  This can describe any board chair.  ASPeN then uses position type to add more granularity.  A board chair position type could be the chair of a library board, the chair of a State Library committee, or even the chair of a State Library council.

Only MSL ASPeN Admins can create position types.  These should always be connected with one of the super types.  If a library needs a new position type, they can let MSL staff know.  We may be able to use an existing position type or if appropriate, create a new position type.
