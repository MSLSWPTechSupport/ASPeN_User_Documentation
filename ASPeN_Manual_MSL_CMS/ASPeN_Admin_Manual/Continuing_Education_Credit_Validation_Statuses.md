Continuing Education Credit Validation Statuses
FirstPrevNextLast
The Montana State Library asks a supervisor, board chair, or administrator to review the continuing education credits of their employee.  This is called validation.  The supervisor can mark a credit as approved or denied.  This is changing the continuing education credit validation status from pending to either approved which means the person took the class or denied which means the person did not take the class or the supervisor did not approve attendance.
