## Introduction

Welcome to Access to Services, Programs, and eNetworks or what we all call ASPeN.

This product is the premier information portal for a variety of services for Montana's library community and is maintained by the Montana State Library - Information Products Group. Members of the public can freely search ASPeN to find a nearby library or learn more about their local library or services.

ASPeN is designed so all Montana Librarians could track their continuing education tracks, past, present, and future.  ASPeN empowers all Montana Librarians to achieve and maintain certification through the MSL.

Other ASPeN users may have additional features enabled.  For example, Library Directors will be able to update their library's information, enroll in certain services, and complete paperwork required by the Montana State Library.

## Navigating to ASPeN

It is easy to navigate to ASPeN! Universally you will always do the same thing.

1. Open your favorite browser.[^browsernote]
2. Enter in the search/address bar:

`aspen.mt.gov`

Today in May 2020 that will redirect you to:

`mslservices.mt.gov/ASPeN/`

But if ASPeN ever moves, this will ALWAYS get you there without the need to remember anything complicated.

_How do I know if I am in the right place?_

Easy you will be on the Search ASPeN page!

## Navigating the Main ASPeN Search Page

The main ASPeN search page is set up as a series of "cards" on a grid down the center of the page.  The informational card at the top followed by...

[Events](#events)
[Organizations](#organizations)
[Services](#services)
[Positions and People](#positions-and-people)
[Committees](#committees)
[Help](#help)

### Events

This is the primary way to browse the MSL Sponsored events or Montana Library Community calendar.

__How do I browse the events?__ Just click the calendar icon to be taken there.

![alt text][calendaricon]

When you get here, you will see the newly revised full-text search for ASPeN events.  Type in your search term, and you will get a filtered list of events based on your terms.  By default, the page will show the past four years of events and all future events.  If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see a table of events listed.

### Organizations

If you are looking for an organization or library, this is the place for you.

__How do I browse organizations?__ Just click the organizations icon to be taken there.

![alt text][organizationicon]

This full-text search page will allow you to search for most any text that is in an organization's ASPeN record.  So a `Missoula School Hellgate` will result in a ranked list of libraries with the terms Missoula, School, Hellgate.  Results with more matches will rank higher.

### Services

__How do I browse MSL Services provided to Libraries?__ Just click the Services icon to be taken there.

![alt text][servicesicon]

This search will provide you services that MSL offers or has offered in the past to Montana Libraries.  The Statewide Projects Consortia Director administers most services.  One key fact here is if you don't know what you seek, click search, and you will get the complete list of services.

### Positions and People

__How do I browse for Positions and People?__ Just click the Positions and People icon to be taken there.

![alt text][psnpplicon]

Why is this named this way? In ASPeN, a person must always belong to a position.  If this isn't true, the person will not appear on the list.  However, if you search, the chances are good that you will locate the person and position you are looking for.  We have done extensive testing, and nearly every time, the vague search terms will find the desired results.

### Committees

__How do I browse MSL Committees?__ Just click the Committees icon to be taken there.

![alt text][committeesicon]

This is just what it says it is.  This is a list of committees.  So these are groups of people.  Typically these are MSL run groups, but any group of people collaborating with the MSL could be listed here.

### Help

__How do I get help?__ Just click the Help icon to be taken there.

![alt text][helpicon]

This will lead you to the MSL help desk.  If you have questions, you can search for answers here or submit a ticket.  This is beyond the prevue of this document.  Feel free to click and look around!
